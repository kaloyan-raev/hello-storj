# Hello Storj

Hello Storj is a demo app for integrating the [libstorj](https://github.com/storj/libstorj) native library in Android. The focus is entirely on the integration and it is not intended to provide any meaningful usability and UX. Future user-focused apps may be based on this project.

If you want to build a similar Android app, you can use the [android-libstorj](https://github.com/storj/android-libstorj) Gradle library. It provides everything you need for working with the Storj network: a Java API and pre-build native libraries for libstorj and all its dependencies. See the [android-libstorj](https://github.com/storj/android-libstorj) repo for instructions.
